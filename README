# Go2 RL Training and Simulation
This project trains a reinforcement learning policy using PPO for the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot in MuJoCo simulation.

## Features
- Custom Gymnasium-compatible environment.
- Reward shaping for stable walking.
- PPO training with Stable-Baselines3.
- TensorBoard logging.
- Evaluation in MuJoCo viewer.
